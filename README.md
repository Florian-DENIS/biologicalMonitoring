# biologicalMonitoring

Welcome to my biologicalMonitoring project repository. This application, built using R and the Shiny package, was made to provide a staff sports team with an efficient data visualization solution. This solution can alert users to anomalies potentially leading to a deterioration in athlete performance and health.

The application is deployed and is directly available [here](https://florian-denis.shinyapps.io/biologicalMonitoring/).

## Data selection tab

The first tab allows you to select the file containing the data (an example file is provided in the project directory). This tab enables you to choose:
- the subjects,
- the dates,
- the variables for your analysis.

## Standard comparison tab

The second tab allows you to compare a specific variable for a selected subject against standard bibliographic references. This feature helps identify any discrepancies or areas of concern in an athlete's performance or medical data.

## Inter-individual comparison tab

The third tab enables you to compare a specific variable for a selected subject against other subjects, potentially from the same training group. This comparison can help identify trends, patterns, or outliers within the group.

## Correlation analysis tab

The fourth tab allows you to search for correlations between different variables in the analysis. Identifying correlations can provide valuable insights into the relationships between various performance and medical factors.

## Raw data tab

The fifth tab provides a means to visualize the raw data, giving you direct access to the underlying information without any aggregation or transformation.
